**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## How do I use Git and GitHub?
Check out our [version control presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j69yFqCbjeLW9g1aLm5GlpNOK6jVuijO4316cb-84bo/edit?usp=sharing).

## Looking for the robot code?
* It may be set as 'private', so you'll need to log in to GitHub with an account with access to the frc2609 organization.
* If you're logged in, make sure you're part of the organization. Click on the "People" tab near the top of the screen, and look for your account. If it isn't there, ask a programming lead (either a student or a mentor) to add you.

## Changing between public and member views

(You'll see private pinned repositories in the home view, as well as the member-exclusive README file.)
